**Preliminary discussion and analysis of ML 1**

Discussion of visualization:

The scatter plot strongly shows a good relationship between %Female Enrollment and %Racial or Ethnic Minority Enrollment, suggesting a positive trend where higher %racial or higher %ethnic minority representation corresponds to an increase in %female enrollment. This potential correlation is visually evident, as the data points generally rise from left to right, implying a connection between institutional diversity and gender equity. While the trend suggests a positive correlation, it is unclear whether the relationship is strictly linear or exhibits a more complex pattern. The data points themselves are clustered at 40-50% Racial or Ethnic Minority with a high percent female  enrollment, whereas there's no cluster at lower percent Racial or Ethnic Minority values. This does make sense because when there are more applications for minorities, there would likely be a positive correlation to higher female percentage enrollments. Also, at lower minority enrollments, values appear more dispersed, suggesting variability in female enrollment percentages at those levels. 

Analysis of code:

The code employs standard linear regression techniques, such as adding the column of ones to encompass the bias aspect of the features. This suggests Employing the ManualLinearRegression model(which can also be confirmed because it's the class used to develop the graphing functions. The graphing functions use mathematical operations to calculate the slope, intercept, and R² score, providing insights into how minority enrollment influences female enrollment. However, it is essential to recognize that relying solely on these two variables may oversimplify broader diversity trends since external factors like institutional policies, geographic influences, or socioeconomic contexts likely play significant roles in the acceptance and enrollment of minorities in colleges. Furthermore, the assumption of independence in the dataset, though supported by the random sampling of colleges, may not account for systemic biases in data collection or representation. A lot of colleges may have inherent biases which may be unbeknownst to many aspiring college students, and therefore the model does not account for qualitative factors, such as biases in the human college admission process.

Ethical considerations:

The analysis of the relationship between % Female Enrollment and % Racial or Ethnic Minority Enrollment raises several ethical considerations. Simplifying diversity into just two variables overlooks its multidimensional nature, including socioeconomic, geographic, and institutional factors. Sampling biases, such as the underrepresentation of certain types of colleges, and neglecting temporal and regional contexts may skew conclusions. Defining thresholds like “high enrollment” or diversity benchmarks introduces implicit biases, potentially masking structural inequalities in access and retention for underrepresented groups. To mitigate these concerns, future work should incorporate additional variables, provide historical and contextual annotations, explore intersectionality, ensure representative sampling, and clearly communicate the model’s assumptions and limitations to whoever is reviewing the model. By addressing these factors, the analysis can better account for the complexities of diversity in higher education.

Further developments:

To further enrich the analysis, incorporating non-linear regression models, such as polynomial regression, could provide deeper insights into potential complexities in the relationship between % Female Enrollment and % Racial or Ethnic Minority Enrollment. The scatter plot suggests variability in female enrollment percentages at lower minority enrollment values and clustering at higher minority enrollment percentages. A non-linear approach, such as polynomial regression, could better capture these trends compared to a linear model. Additionally, exploring interaction effects between % Racial or Ethnic Minority Enrollment and other variables, such as institutional size, geographic location, or type (ex: public vs. private), could help identify how these factors jointly influence female enrollment rates. Including temporal data could also uncover changes in these trends over time, particularly in response to policy shifts or societal events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding the dataset to include socioeconomic variables and retention rates would provide a more holistic view of diversity efforts and their impact. 

**Preliminary discussion and analysis of ML 2**

Overview:
Our preliminary results of ML2 train the classifier to be able to identify wether a year or a college/institution enrollment percentage combination of the two, corresponds with the "High Enrollment" level. From this model, high enrollment is defined as greater than 15,000. The decision_function gives us the distance from the data point to the feature value.
Plots Analysis:
The visualization of this data is put into a scatter plot using Plotly. The X axis is the year that we are looking at and the Y is the percentage of public Institution Enrollment. For this model since we are training the model to learn how to differenciate a college from having a high enrollment level or not, the colour indicated wether the high enrollment value that is given by the ML is true [1] or false [0]. The size of the dot on the scatter plot, ie each dot's radius indicates the probibility of the classidication made by the classifier model. From this scatter plot it is observing the Year and the percentage of Public Institution Enrollment in relation to the ML models high enrollment status prediction. (Wether the point is greater than or less thatn 15,000 students at that givens points instition.) 
Potential Ethical Concerns:
One ethical concern that is brought fourth through ML model 2 is the idea of a bias from our calculation of the threshold for what is defined by the model as a "high enrollment" institution. For some a high enrollment could be another value, such as anything over 10,000 students or stricly colleges with over 20,000 students. This threshold of what is a high enrollment institution was inputted by us therefore our implicit bias of what a large enrollment school is was put into the model. Another ethical concern of specifically our dataset to look at is how the data is changed from the years of 2020 onwards. Due to the decrease of enrollment at all institutions in the US in the school year following the pandemic (fall of 2020) the data is automatically sckewed and thererfore arises an ethical concern of if this should be marked on the graph as a poetntial area of concern. This could become misleading to the viewer because they could have no prior knowlege of the decrease in applications in the fall of 2020. A third ethical concern that was brought to our attention is the data in the prediction range of 50% - 57.7% are classified as false, however this is something that could be reassessed because the prediction is still over 50 so therefore is still on a good scale and has a good chance of being potentially probably because it is over 50%. 
Conclusion:
Conclusively, the model is working as intended however there is still room for improvement, as there is with any model. In this one specifically, one element that I am looking to change is the year potion on the x axis as well as the hover data year element. Though it is working as intended and the values correspond with the correct institution it would be easier for the view to analyze the data with the year given in the usual format of (ie. 1980, 2015, 2004) This format would make it easier to see if there was in influx or decrease at a certain period of time. This would also make it easier to see how the year that I mentioned above in the ethical concern portion of (2020) would relate to this model. Overall, the model is performing as intended and the colours of red and blue make the visual easy to read as well as the helpful key on the right hand side.
