**Preliminary discussion and analysis of ML 2**

The scatter plot shows the % Female Enrollment vs. % Racial or Ethnic Minority Enrollment. The graph shows a possible positive trend between the two variables, because we see a general increase in % Female enrollment, as % Racial or Ethnic Minority increases.

Although the model does suggest a pattern for a positive correlation, we're unsure whether this suggests a linear relationship or not. In terms of linearity, the scatterplot does exhibit a plausible trend line going through the points to make a regression line fit the model. The data does suggest independence as the studies were generated randomly from random colleges.

Overview:
Our preliminary results of ML2 train the classifier to be able to identify wether a year or a college/institution enrollment percentage combination of the two, corresponds with the "High Enrollment" level. From this model, high enrollment is defined as greater than 15,000. The decision_function gives us the distance from the data point to the feature value.
Plots Analysis:
The visualization of this data is put into a scatter plot using Plotly. The X axis is the year that we are looking at and the Y is the percentage of public Institution Enrollment. For this model since we are training the model to learn how to differenciate a college from having a high enrollment level or not, the colour indicated wether the high enrollment value that is given by the ML is true [1] or false [0]. The size of the dot on the scatter plot, ie each dot's radius indicates the probibility of the classidication made by the classifier model. From this scatter plot it is observing the Year and the percentage of Public Institution Enrollment in relation to the ML models high enrollment status prediction. (Wether the point is greater than or less thatn 15,000 students at that givens points instition.) 
Potential Ethical Concerns:
One ethical concern that is brought fourth through ML model 2 is the idea of a bias from our calculation of the threshold for what is defined by the model as a "high enrollment" institution. For some a high enrollment could be another value, such as anything over 10,000 students or stricly colleges with over 20,000 students. This threshold of what is a high enrollment institution was inputted by us therefore our implicit bias of what a large enrollment school is was put into the model. Another ethical concern of specifically our dataset to look at is how the data is changed from the years of 2020 onwards. Due to the decrease of enrollment at all institutions in the US in the school year following the pandemic (fall of 2020) the data is automatically sckewed and thererfore arises an ethical concern of if this should be marked on the graph as a poetntial area of concern. This could become misleading to the viewer because they could have no prior knowlege of the decrease in applications in the fall of 2020. A third ethical concern that was brought to our attention is the data in the prediction range of 50% - 57.7% are classified as false, however this is something that could be reassessed because the prediction is still over 50 so therefore is still on a good scale and has a good chance of being potentially probably because it is over 50%. 
Conclusion:
Conclusively, the model is working as intended however there is still room for improvement, as there is with any model. In this one specifically, one element that I am looking to change is the year potion on the x axis as well as the hover data year element. Though it is working as intended and the values correspond with the correct institution it would be easier for the view to analyze the data with the year given in the usual format of (ie. 1980, 2015, 2004) This format would make it easier to see if there was in influx or decrease at a certain period of time. This would also make it easier to see how the year that I mentioned above in the ethical concern portion of (2020) would relate to this model. Overall, the model is performing as intended and the colours of red and blue make the visual easy to read as well as the helpful key on the right hand side.
