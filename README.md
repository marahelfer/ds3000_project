**Preliminary discussion and analysis of ML 2**

The scatter plot shows the % Female Enrollment vs. % Racial or Ethnic Minority Enrollment. The graph shows a possible positive trend between the two variables, because we see a general increase in % Female enrollment, as % Racial or Ethnic Minority increases.

Although the model does suggest a pattern for a positive correlation, we're unsure whether this suggests a linear relationship or not. In terms of linearity, the scatterplot does exhibit a plausible trend line going through the points to make a regression line fit the model. The data does suggest independence as the studies were generated randomly from random colleges.
